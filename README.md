Several things to train a donkey car controller
1. install pytorch on jetson nano

model will be trained by torch  1.13.1

2. try static model on nano 

fixed output to test inference time (both test on cpu and gpu)


3. collect dataset

training set:60,000

test set: 10,000

4. extract control instructions from dataset( better to transferA)
